# sentiment.analysis
Project Description:
The goal of this project was to perform sentiment analysis of stock prices based on news articles. I implemented various data preprocessing techniques and applied sentiment analysis algorithms using Python libraries, particularly focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and Scikit-learn.

The project involved developing machine learning classifiers, including Naive Bayes and Random Forest, to predict sentiment based on the content of news articles. I utilized the power of these classifiers to analyze the sentiment associated with the news and its potential impact on stock prices.

To achieve high accuracy in sentiment prediction, we carefully processed the data using efficient data preprocessing techniques. This involved tasks such as text cleaning, and feature extraction. These steps ensured that the input data was transformed into a suitable format for the machine learning algorithms.

By leveraging the capabilities of Python libraries, I successfully built and implemented a highly accurate sentiment analysis model. The model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 86%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting sentiment related to stock prices based on news articles.

Overall, this project combined the fields of finance, natural language processing, and machine learning to create a robust sentiment analysis system. By analyzing news articles, I aimed to provide valuable insights into the sentiment surrounding stocks and their potential impact on the financial market. The project's outcomes can be utilized by investors, financial analysts, and traders to make informed decisions and stay updated on market trends.
